# Lost-and-Found-Locker-Box-Arduino-Code
This Arduino code creates a smart locker system controlled by an IR remote. Users enter a locker number and a PIN to operate a servo motor lock. The system provides comprehensive user feedback through an LCD for prompts, an RGB LED for visual status (blue, green, red), and a buzzer for distinct audible alerts on key presses and actions.
